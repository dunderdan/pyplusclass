2a. Create a list where each of the list elements is a dictionary representing one of the network devices in the lab. 
Do this for at least four of the lab devices. The dictionary should have keys corresponding to the device_name, 
host (i.e. FQDN), username, and password. Use a fictional username/password to avoid checking the lab password into GitHub.

2b. Write the data structure you created in part 2a out to a YAML file. Use expanded YAML format. 
How could you re-use this YAML file later when creating Netmiko connections to devices?
